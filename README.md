# TURNWAYS-language
## The vertically oriented coding language!

In Turnways, code is parsed top to bottom, then left to right. In other words, it is processed by columns.
Output from Turnways is also presented in vertical orientation, naturally.
Examples programs are provided in the "Examples" directory of the TURNWAYS-language repository.
